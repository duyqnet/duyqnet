### 🌟 About Me

I’m all about the blend of **technical precision** with a sense of **creativity, curiosity, and fun**. While I’m dedicated to crafting robust software, I believe that both tech (and life) are about **learning, connecting**, and **finding inspiration** every step of the way.

In both work and life, I look up to unique “role models”:
- 🛠️ **MacGyver**: for problem-solving persistence and creativity.
- 🎾 **Roger Federer**: for discipline, flair, and striving for excellence.
- 🎸 **Jimi Hendrix**: for improvisational brilliance and creativity in everything.

If I can approach my projects with even a hint of their ingenuity, I know I’m onto something good!
